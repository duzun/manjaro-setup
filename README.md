My setup scripts for Linux Manjaro

I don't like spending too much time installing and configuring my working system,
but rather would prefer speding time using it productively. 
Hence these scripts that help me get up and running with a new system as quick as possible.


Take a looks at `manjaro_install_apps.sh`, `manjaro_install_cli.sh` & `manjaro_install_web_dev.sh`.
Before running any of these, I encourage you to open them in a text editor and review what is going to be installed,
comment/uncomment depending on your needs, then `chmod +x *.sh` and execute.

If you are like me, spending a lot of time in the console, with lots of terminals all over the screen, I'm sure you have your own dotfiles.
In any case, here are mine: [duzun/âŠ™](https://github.com/duzun/dotfiles) ðŸ˜‰
