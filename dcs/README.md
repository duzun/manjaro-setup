# Docker Compose tools

## What is this?

This is a list of web development tools started in containers.

It starts Traefik on 127.0.0.2 to proxy to containers by labels:

```sh
PROJECT=$(pwd | sed 's#[/.]#-#g; s/^-//g')
docker compose -p "$PROJECT" up -d
```

Optionally you can start Nginx Proxy Manager on 127.0.0.3 for a UI to manage
poxing to other containers:

```sh
PROJECT=$(pwd | sed 's#[/.]#-#g; s/^-//g')
docker compose -p "$PROJECT" -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.npm.yml up -d
```

## TLS proxy

There are two ways to proxy an HTTPS website through traefik:
pasthrough or HTTPS -> HTTP.

In pasthrough mode the target server implements HTTPS
(no certificate needed for traefik).

In HTTPS -> HTTP mode traefik needs a valid TLS certificate.

For containers started here there is `server.pem` certificate,
signed with self-signed root CA: `ca/duzun_root_CA.crt`.

`ca/duzun_root_CA.crt` must be in the trusted root ca
(see https://www.archlinux.org/news/ca-certificates-update/).

If you use Firefox as a browser you will need to import the public ca.crt certificate into Firefox directly.
Firefox does not use the local operating systemâ€™s certificate store:

If you are using your CA to integrate with a Windows environment or desktop computers, please see the documentation on how to use certutil.exe:
